# Instant book generation using OpenAI's Large Language Models

Bookwriter is an app that lets you generate an entire book (structure and content) using OpenAI's APIs
Currently this app uses gpt-3.5-turbo, the same model that powers chatGPT.
It works by first generating the outline of the book (chapters and sections)
