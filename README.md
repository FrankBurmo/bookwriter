# Instant book generation using OpenAI's Large Language Models

Bookwriter is an app that lets you generate an entire book (structure and content) using OpenAI's APIs
Currently this app uses gpt-3.5-turbo, the same model that powers chatGPT.
It works by first generating the outline of the book (chapters,sections and subsections), and later separating each subsection into individual parts.
It's these parts that are finally generated by GPT.

# Before using the app

You need to provide your OpenAI API key by creating a file named ".env" at the root of the repo
The file should contain a line with "REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-somerandomstring'"
Please note the presence of single quotes '' enclosing the api key

# Start the app

Run `npm start` to launch the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# First step: Description of the book

![Description of the book](/description.png)
Enter what would be the title of your book, and a short description of it.

# Second step: Generation of the outline

Here you can generate the outline of the book.
The result of the generation is displayed on the top. You can edit the text manually or re-generate over it.
Once you're satisfied, click "parse" to make the app parse the text.
Beware that:
Chapters must be in the form "Chapter XX. Title of the chapter"
Sections must be in the form "\tSection Y. Section name" (notice the \t representing a single tab character)
Subsections must be in the form "\t\t-Title of subsection" (notice the 2 tabs \t this time)
This format was chosen because it seems to work best for GPT 3.5

# Third step: Parts and contents of the book

![Parts of the book](/content_generation.png)
Select a an item/subsection on the left panel and generate appropriate parts on the right.
You can manually remove some parts of re-generate them all.
Once you have selected a part, you can generate the content associated with it.
